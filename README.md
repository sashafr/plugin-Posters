# PostersPenn

*[A Penn Libraries Digital Scholarship Project](https://guides.library.upenn.edu/digital-scholarship)*

Expands on the existing [Posters plugin](https://github.com/omeka/plugin-Posters) to add a button for adding items to posters on the items/browse and items/show pages (attempting to bring Posters closer to functioning like a cart). We have also created themes that rebrand this plugin to actually be [a cart](https://github.com/upenndigitalscholarship/archaebot_database) or [a marked bibliography list](https://github.com/upenndigitalscholarship/archaeobib).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Installing this plugin requires having a live Omeka Classic site to install it into.  More information on how to deploy an Omeka classic site can be found on our [github](https://github.com/upenndigitalscholarship/dsdocs/blob/master/omeka_install.md) or on the [Omeka installation guide](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Installation/Installation/).

Also requires [GuestUser plugin](https://github.com/omeka/plugin-GuestUser).

### Installing

Once you have an Omeka Classic site up and running, you must clone the plugin-Posters into the plugins folder and rename to Posters. Note that if you already have a version of the Posters plugin installed, you should uninstall it before continuing.

Once your have cloned the repository into your plugins folder, simply visit the admin page of your Omeka site and navigate to the plugins page, which should be in the top right navigation bar.  You should see Posters listed on this page and can install it by pressing the install button to the right of the plugin.
